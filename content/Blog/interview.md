Title: Interviews

A lot of people at Hacker School get stressed with jobs near the end of their batch. I thought I could avoid the stress, since I was doing GNOME's Outreach Program for Women (OPW) afterwards. But no, I just ended up postponing it.

I interviewed at any place that would interview with me. I know a lot of people prefer to only interview at places they really want to work at. However, I wasn't sure where I wanted to work. I had a few preferences (Python shop, small company size, interesting projects), but otherwise, I was pretty clueless.

Even though interviewing took a lot of time and emotional energy, I am really glad I interviewed everywhere. I learned a lot about different companies and the challenges they face. I also learned how different the interview process was at the various companies. Some did the traditional white-boarding, some were all done through the computer. Even the questions were vastly different. The biggest thing I learned was that all these companies have different needs. Thus, just because you don't get a job at one company doesn't make you a bad engineer (even though I felt horribly incompetent when I got my first rejection). There is a good chance that you just didn't fit their needs. Or you just completely bombed it, in which case you'll do better next time! There is no "rockstar engineer" (I really hate that term) that could get all the job offers from any tech company. Companies are looking for someone who can ramp-up quickly and do the job. That job might be very different company A and company B.

Some companies required a take-home assignment. At first, I hated this, as it took up a lot of time. But in the end, I ended up learning a lot from it! Some assignments ended up being a ton of fun as well.

I also enjoyed reading the blog, [This is why you don't hire good developers](http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/). In the end, it is hard for both sides. It definitely feels like dating. When you have a great fit, it is quite magical.

I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted in a job while interviewing at these companies. The biggest thing I discovered is that I wanted to work on a product that I actually use, which was a surprise. I also wanted to work at a smaller company, where I would have a great impact, but big enough where I would have people to learn from.

I also realized as I interviewed more, I was getting better at interviewing. I stopped getting nervous when I did a phone screen or an onsite. I was getting better at explaining my projects. I was able to concisely explain my Hacker School project in 3-5 minutes, as well as dive really deep into the project, turning it into a 30-45 minute conversation. I think this is the most important skill I gained. One company asked me to do a presentation of my Hacker School project, which was a blessing in disguised. I basically created a talk about my project and practiced in front of Hacker School facilitators, who fact checked my explanations. That definitely helped in future interviews.

I also rejected a lot of offers early on, which I am glad I did. I ended up being really picky about where I wanted to work.

I really wish I could give some solid interviewing tips. But honestly, I feel like going to hackathons and coding projects I really cared about ended up helping the most. I also ended up listening to a shit ton of interesting PyCon and OpenBridge talks, which also helped! I did try studying with Cracking the Coding Interview, but honestly, it didn't really work for me. I would definitely study up on algorithms and data structures if you do plan on applying to bigger places like Google.

I had five great offers to choose from. I definitely negotiated thanks to [Valerie Aurora's blog post](http://valerieaurora.org/howto_salary/)!

In the end, I decided to go with.....

Yup! I ended up working at Lyft and couldn't be happier.

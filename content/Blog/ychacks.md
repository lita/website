I participated in YC Hacks, the first ever hackathon hosted by Y Combinator. I found out about it through Hacker News and surprised I got in.

I applied without a team, and completely forgot about it till the week of the hackathon. I was about to email the organizers stating I wouldn't go, since I didn't have an idea or a team. However, I am glad I didn't. The night before, I went to a mixer meant for people to find teams. I met Jimmy and a fellow hacker schooler, who convince me to go. Jimmy stated that a lot of people applied to get in, and it would be a wasted opportunity if you didn't.

So I decided to go. I found a team and we made something awesome. We made a game called [Tunes Against Humanity](https://github.com/sasilukr/tunes-against-humanity), which is a music spin-off of "Cards Against Humanity". We made it with Firebase and Bop.fm's API. We ended up winning the grand prize for Music Hack from Bop.fm.

I haven't been to many Hackathons. However, I felt I learned a lot about YC 

###Office Hours
During the YC Hackathon, we had the opportunity to have office hours with the alumni of YC. Originally, I thought this was get help with our hack. But I found out it we could get general startup advice. I was able to sit in on my teammates office hour and hear some founders advice. Everyone there seemed really eager to help each other out, which was surprising. I thought startup incubator would be a lot more cut throat. However, the YC network seems really tight knit, and super willing to help each other.

Now I understand why if you want to start a startup, it helps to be in SF. I don't think you can get that kind of a network anywhere else.


##The Bad
So the hack

Here is what I learned about Hackathons. 

It is important to spec your idea before your start coding. I loved that my team talked about functionality and design before coding things out. However, 

I feel like every time I go to a Hackathon, I end up coding in Javascript.

I learned a lot about startups there.

However, I noticed there was a mixer going on the night before. So I decided I would go to that and determine if I went.

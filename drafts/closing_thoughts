Wow, I can't believe three months already went by. Time moves SO fast when you are having too much fun. I am really sad that everyone is leaving soon. Hopefully, I can try and keep in contact with everyone I met here.

My main project was making a Bittorrent client that streams video. It went through many incarnations as I try to optimize it.

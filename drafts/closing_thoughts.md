Closing thoughts:

Hacker School is finally over. It was a big risk for me. My job at Dreamworks Animation was pretty cushy. I feel like I could have worked there for 15 years. Change is scary. I seriously applied the night that the application was due, and I honestly didn't expect to get in because my application was so rushed.

When Allison accepted my admission, I was working a Saturday at Peabody and Sherman because it was "crunch time" (the time where all the shit needed to get done) and  Do I regret doing it? No.

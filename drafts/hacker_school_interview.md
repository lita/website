Why did you go to Hacker School?
Short answer? I wanted to get better at programming. This seems like the perfect place for it.

I was working at Dreamworks, doing mostly Python development. I thought I knew the language really well, but I didn't.

For me, I wanted to learn about the web and get better at web programming. I came from a computer graphics background, I wanted to make a career change. I feel like Hacker School was the perfect place for me to do that.

After hearing about Hacker School through the Etsy Engineering Blog, I decided to apply the NIGHT the application was due.

After interviewing with the facilitators, I got accepted into the program. I tried to do a ton of research. There wasn't THAT much out there on the internet. But after reading their Student Guide Book, I realized I could grow a lot here. They check to make sure that everyone is really nice and supportive.

What did you do at Hacker School?
In the end, I ended up learning a TON about Python and network programming. I wrote a Bittorrent Client from scratch using Python! I haven't had to deal with writing raw bytes in a long time! I dealt sockets and made my own asynchronous loop. I also learned how about concurrency, using Python's multi-threading and multi-processing libraries, and the pros and cons of that. 

On top of that, I used my Bittorrent Client to make a web app to view streaming video while the torrent file was playing. I learned A LOT about streaming over the Internet, and dealing with video metadata. 

I also got a taste of functional programming, by learning Elm. After working with concurrency, I really LOVE immutable data structures and want to get better at functional programming.

After coming to Hacker School, I realized I didn't know Python deeply as I thought. So I focused on learning about using the functional aspects of Python, decorators, generators, and Python's garbage collection. I even downloaded the source of the CPython interpretor and contributed to the project!

Tell me about your favorite software project, and what you'd like to add to it.
My favorite software project was my Video Streamer! It was so cool to start off with something small and build your way up to this massive code base.
